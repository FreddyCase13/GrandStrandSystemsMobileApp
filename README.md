1) How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
   
    I will ensure my code is functional and secure by utilizing QA testing during the development process. Testing code for faults frequently will ensure that my code works seamlessly and that faults wont break the system.

3) How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

    I interpret user needs and incorporare them into a program by understanding how I can transform user stories given from the product owner/project manager and create that feature into workable code.

4) How do I approach designing software?

     I approach designing software by first utilizing UML diagrams to understand the logic of how the program will function. Then I write pseudocode so that I will know what classes to create, what items it will need, and ensuring the classes work together. That lays out the blueprint on how I write my programs. I also utilize frequent testing to ensure that my code is functional and free of faults!
